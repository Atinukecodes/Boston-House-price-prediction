Boston Housing Price Prediction
This project explores predictive modeling for housing prices using the Boston Housing dataset. It compares multiple regression techniques and evaluates the impact of feature selection on model performance.

 Objectives
Predict MEDV (Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s)

Compare regression models: Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and Random Forest

Evaluate performance using RÂ² and Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Analyze feature correlations and apply feature reduction

Visualize model performance and residuals

Models Used
Model	Description
Linear Regression	Baseline model for comparison
Ridge Regression	Regularized linear model (L2 penalty)
Lasso Regression	Regularized linear model with feature selection (L1 penalty)
Random Forest	Ensemble model capturing nonlinear relationships
 Evaluation Metrics
RÂ² Score: Measures how well the model explains variance in the target

MSE: Measures average squared error between predicted and actual values

 Feature Engineering
Used mutual information to identify top 5 influential features

Applied correlation heatmap to detect multicollinearity

Compared model performance on full vs reduced feature sets

 Visualizations
Residual plots for models.

Bar charts comparing RÂ² and MSE across models

Correlation heatmap to guide feature selection

 Results Summary
Spoiler Alert: Random Forest outperformed all other models with highest RÂ² and lowest MSE

Linear, Ridge, and Lasso showed similar performance, with slight degradation after feature reduction

Feature reduction helped simplify models but slightly reduced accuracy
